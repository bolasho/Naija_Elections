  <p style="font-size: calc(0.18em + 1vmin)">
      Female voters  are slightly likely to vote other parties than male voters. Voters age-groups 18-45 are more likely to vote other political parties compare to 45+ age-group.
      Voters in North-Central, South-West and South-South are more likely to vote others.
      Which means voters resentment against both APC and PDP are rife among women and in North-Central,South-West and South-South Geo-political zones and Age-Group 18-45 . Even though there is resentment , it is not enough to change the status quo of voters preferences among the leading political parties, APC and PDP which still hold 97% of voters preferences.
      Therefore our analysis was based on this 2 major parties.
     APC leads across all Geo-political zones except South-East and South-South and across all Age-Group, Income, Gender,and employment status.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: calc(0.18em + 1vmin)">
     On voters sentiments Buhari and Atiku has similar approval ratings. But APC have stronger approval rating than PDP, this is the reason why Buhari is leading Atiku. The polls result is 57% Buhari and 40% percent Atiku. The poll margin of error is plus or minus 3% which means true result of Buhari could be between 60% to 54% and Atiku is somewhere between 43%-37%. APC approval is 73% while PDP is 42%,if we average the party sentiments and candidate sentiment which is APC plus Buhari average rating (73+47)/2=60% ,which is similar to Buhari's higher margin of 60%, same for Atiku and PDP(47+42)=44.5% which is not too far from Atiku higher margin of 43%. Atiku is actually more popular than his party, his party is driving him down,while Buhari is lifted by his party.The Verdict is Buhari to win as of today, he is winning across all voters demography.
