   <p style="font-size:calc(0.3em + 1vmin)">--Some of the key words associated with Buhari when voters mentioned his names are "crowd ,address, breaking,news".Which indicate that during the campaign the president have been received by huge crowds and also the president have also made a number of gaffe which have resulted in breaking news and opposition have taken advantage of this.   Words like "admonish, failure,replace" also indicate that the perception was that, the president admonishes opposition and replaces staff he perceived as enemy with loyal one which often comes from one region. </p>

  <p style="font-size: calc(0.18em + 1vmin)">
      Male voters are more likely to vote Sowore and female voters more likely to vote Kingsley Morghalu apart from Atiku and Buhari, 
      Voter between the 18-44 are more likely to vote Sowore and age group 45 and over are more likely to vote Kingsley Morghalu if both Buhari and Atiku are excluded.
      Voters with income range 20k-60k per month are more likely to vote Sowore while voters with in 60k+ per month are more likely to vote for Kingsley Morghalu, if both Atiku and Buhari are excluded.
      Voters from the south are slightly more likely to vote Sowore and voters from the North are slightly more likely to vote Kingsley Morghalu, if both Atiku and Buhari are excluded 
      from the analysis. 
      
  <p style="font-size: calc(0.18em + 1vmin)">
     Atiku has gain 11% from last month approval rating, the momentum is really with the PDP candidate at this time. There is North south divide, Atiku has managed to garner more vote in the north than expected and he is leading comfortably in the south, while Buhari is leading comfortably in the north, he is not doing well in the south particularly among young people in the south, if the president wants to win, he needs to get more youth vote in the south and really connect with them because a lot of them are voting third party and in this poll this will hurt the president chance of re-election.
     Although Atiku is leading slightly by 1.74% the verdict is ,the election is too close to call as the lead is within the margin of error of this poll 3.3%. If i was INEC i will be preparing for these election to be very close like Osun. Whoever wins ,it will be few thousands votes that will decide the elections.
