      Voters with No employment are more likely to vote Sowore compare to other candidate apart from Buhari and Atiku, voters who employed are more likely to vote Ezekwezili compare to other candidate apart from the 2 major candidates
      Female voters  are more likely to vote for OTHERS compared to the rest apart from the 2 major candidates, male voters are more likely to vote for Ezekwezili. Sowore is popular amongst voters with no income and low income, while ezekwezili is popular among higher income earners if both Buhari and Atiku are excluded from the analysis. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: calc(0.18em + 1vmin)">
     On voters sentiments Buhari and Atiku has similar approval ratings. But APC approval has taken a knock since the campaign started the ruling party had to contend with series of negative attacks from opposition party and also attacks from boko-haram, there has been a 6% increase in voters sentiments towards PDP. Despite this Atiku has slipped in the poll by 5.3%,the decrease is driving largely by adding 2 more candidates to the poll, this 2 candidates took voting share off Atiku while Buhari increase his polling share by 2.2%. This is the strange thing about Nigeria elections, in other climes you would expect the Buhari to be trailing in the polls given all the negativity , but alas this is not the case. Buhari is leading by wide margin in North-West and North-East, he is leading by a lower margin in North-Central and South-West, while Atiku is leading by wide margin in South-East and a lower margin in South-South.Buhari on 59.2% , Atiku 34.7%. The verdict is Buhari to win as of today.
